# Smart_Security_System_by_using_Arduino_CSE360_Project
BRACU CSE360: Computer Interfacing Course Lab Project
This is a group project. Our proposed automated system is very power efficient and requires basic electronic equipment. We will use a bluetooth transceiver module for remotely controlling the system, an IR sensor for detecting presence of any person, an MQ2 gas/smoke sensor for detecting any gas-leak or smoke from within the enclosed space and a buzzer for auditory warning. We will use a servo motor to represent hazardous machinery. To connect and coordinate all of these components, we will use an Arduino Uno board to interface all of them and it is more than powerful enough to handle all our intended operations.
